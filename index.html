      </div>
      <div>
        <p>For this project, I was assigned to create an interactive platform that revolved around the theme of Borders. Inspired by artist JessXSnow's work <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rN0fdwq30I">"Migration is Natural,"</a> I chose to create a site that centers around three different stories of immigrant women of color using motifs of birds, the night sky, and constellations. For this project, I focused on the emotional impact of narrative and storytelling, while also implementing user interactivity in order to encourage them to learn more about the issues presented here.

        <p>For this project, I was responsible for creating a quad-fold pamphlet that describes the physical space of the UC Davis Women's Resources & Research Center and the resources that they offer to both on and off-campus communities. I conducted research and interviews with staff and community members of the WRRC to create a pamphlet that is clear and cohesive, as well as representative of the WRRC's brand and identity.</p>

      <div>
        <p>For this project, I worked with the non-profit organization, International House, Davis and Taller Arte Del Nuevo Amanecer (TANA), to create an exhibition poster for their "Humanizing Deporation" showcase, where they exhibited different works of art centered around the issues related to deportation in the U.S. Using the screen print images provided by TANA paired with imagery of the sky and birds, I showcased the themes of the exhibition to represent the ongoing struggles of migrants and their goals of liberation, freedom, and safety.</p>

      <div>
        <p>For my UI/UX design class, I developed a comprehensive prototype of an app called "SafeSpace," an app that would serve as a deescalation resource for those experiencing mental health crises. After conducting research about this issue, I found that individuals with untreated mental illnesses were 16 times more likely to be shot by police than those without any, which is an alarming rate. For this project, I decided to design and prototype an app that would help prevent police encounters for those experiencing crises but also be able to gain help from a network of crisis support counselors.

        <h3>Awareness Event Posters</h3>
        <h6 class="subline">Graphic design</h6>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>The UC Davis Women's Resources and Research Center is responsible for planning and hosting several awareness months/days for the campus community in order to raise awareness of issues faced by underserved communities. I have designed posters for Gender Equity Awareness Month and International Women's Day, both of which have vector illustrations that relay the theme or main speaker for each event.</p>

        <h5>International Women's Day 2019</h5>
        <p>For this project, I used warm colors and a vector illustrated image of Virgie Tovar, the guest speaker for this event, in order for the poster to stand out and draw people in.</p>

        <h5>Gender Equity Awareness Month</h5>
        <p>The theme for this awareness month was nature, water and connectedness. In order to communicate that, I created a vector illustration of two hands holding water with foliage bordering the illustration. I used cool, pastel colors to invoke a sense of calm and peace to the viewer. In addition, I used a simple grid format with clear type hierarchy to showcase the events for that month.</p>

      <div>
        <p>These catalogs were designed for the non-profit organization International House, Davis (I-House) to include information and details about their hosted events for their members and the Davis community. The goal for this project was to create a catalog that was simple yet connected to I-House's new brand design and their tenets of community. To accomplish this, I created a cohesive grid format for their catalog that prioritized important information and included photos from previous I-House events to create a sense of family and connection.</p>

        <p>I was tasked with creating the program for the 2018 Southeast Asian Graduation at UC Davis, which was distributed among about 300 guests at the venue.
